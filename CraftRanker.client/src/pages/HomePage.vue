      <p class="text-info text-center">Good advice can be hard to find:<br />We learned that the hard way.</p>
      <div class="text-max">
        <p>Our success on Etsy wasn't overnight. And it wasn't an accident, or "good luck."" It was the
          result of meticulous
          testing, research, mistakes (lots of mistakes) and doing more of what worked (and less of what didn't!). </p>
        <p>
          That's why, after years of hard work (and success in becoming a top-1% Etsy shop!) we love sending the elevator
          back down to other Etsy sellers who are in the same place we were at years ago. Because a rising tide lifts all
          ships. And when Etsy gets stronger as a platform with sellers who know the ropes, we all benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our success is replicable. Which means that you can do it in your shop too. And we'd love to teach you how.

          <p class="mb-2">I've been away from selling on Etsy for over seven years, and I knew coming back, I was walking
            into a completely different selling experience. I had no desire to overwhelm myself with internet rabbit holes
            and google searches trying to figure out what changed and what that meant for me ... I highly recommend this
            to any new sellers or anyone coming back to Etsy after a few years away. I wish I would have had it years ago
            when I tried to sell the first time.</p>
